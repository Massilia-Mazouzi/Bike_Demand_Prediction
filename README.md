# Bike Sharing Demand Forecasting

This repository contains my project on **forecasting hourly demand** for a bike-sharing service

### Key points:
- Implemented **ML and DL architectures** (RNN, LSTM with attention)
- Engineered features for **seasonality, weather, and temporal patterns**  

 See the notebook for code and explanations
